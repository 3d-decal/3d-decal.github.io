<a name="required-supplies" class="anchor" href="#required-supplies"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Required Supplies</h3>

<p>Students will need to purchase around $10 or $15 worth of 3d printer plastic filament in order to print their projects. Details will be given on week 2. </p>

<h2>
<a name="course-description" class="anchor" href="#course-description"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Course Description</h2>

<p>We will discuss the maker movement and how it relates to 3d printing. Students will be taught how to design, revise, and print objects of their own creation.</p>

<h3>
<a name="aims" class="anchor" href="#aims"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Aims</h3>

<p>The course is aimed at students interested in artistic design or engineering, but all backgrounds are welcome.</p>

<h3>
<a name="requirements" class="anchor" href="#requirements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements</h3>

<p>The only requirement is that students have the creativity and vision to design their own functional and artistic objects, which will be printed for midterm and final projects.</p>

<h3>
<a name="course-objectives" class="anchor" href="#course-objectives"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Course Objectives</h3>

<p>We will be giving you hands-on experience in how to design and print 3d files, so that in and outside the class you will be able to design and print objects you get to keep.</p>

<h3>

<ul>
<li>Where: 130 Wheeler</li>
<li>When: Tuesday 5-7pm</li>
<li>What: Lecture on topic listed on the syllabus, in-class discussions, peer reviews on projects, and possibly guest lectures.</li>

<a name="posts-20" class="anchor" href="#posts-20"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Posts: 20%</h4>

<p>Post a link to a current event relating to 3D printing or the maker movement. Do this via the (<a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B07OIri8iGyaYm9DaTVVQnJGRk0&amp;usp=sharing">public docs folder</a>).</p>

<a name="small-midterm-projects-40" class="anchor" href="#small-midterm-projects-40"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Small Midterm Projects: 40%</h4>

<p>There will be three smaller projects. Students will design and print an object; specific criteria will be posted before each project.</p>

<p>You will be graded on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Printability: It needs to be printable. We'll talk more about this in lecture 2. </li>
<li>Utility or artfulness: It has to do something and/or express something artistic. Nothing boring. </li>
<li>Adherence to volume limitations: If it's too big to be printed, that's also a problem</li>
<li>Functioning weapons are an automatic 0. (I'm not taking a stance, this is just safety and common sense.) </li>
</ul><h4>
<a name="final-project-40" class="anchor" href="#final-project-40"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Final Project: 40%</h4>

<p>For the last portion of the class, students will contribute to a current project within the maker movement. This is through designing or modifying a 3d drawing and then printing it out. It is also possible to do some other project, so long as it relates to the maker movement. </p>

<p>Students will be graded on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Printability: It needs to be printable. We'll talk more about this in lecture 2. </li>
<li>Utility or artfulness: It has to do something and/or express something artistic. Nothing boring. </li>
<li>Adherence to volume limitations: If it's too big to be printed, that's also a problem</li>
<li>Functioning weapons are an automatic 0.</li>
<li>Relevance -- Does it influence, assist, or contribute to a current project within the realm of the maker movement.</li>

<h3>
<a name="3d-printing" class="anchor" href="#3d-printing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3D Printing</h3>

<ul>
<li>Week 1: The maker movement and its effect on the development of the RepRap and other open 3d printer designs. What 3d printers have done for the maker movement, why 3D printers are awesome. Tutorials on where to get 3d designs (thingiverse). Cool things you can make with a 3D printer.<br>
</li>
<li>Week 1-2 HW: Find something you want printed on thingiverse, sign up for dreambox, and have the part printed. Bring it in on week 2 so we can discuss.</li>
<li>Week 2: How to create/modify CAD files for use on a 3d printer. We will go over how to use tinkercad, but students are encouraged to use any cadding suite they want, provided it can export to STL. We will also brainstorm in groups designs suitable for 3d printing. </li>
<li>Week 2-3 HW: Students will think up and draw something they can CAD. Students are to email in before next week a picture of what they plan to make so I can put it in the lecture slides and so we can discuss. </li>
<li>Week 3: 3d printing and politics: Obamaâ€™s 3d printing portion of his state of the union speech and where politics are pushing 3d printing. Defense distributed. 
Students will group during class according to what type of thing they want to print, and then discuss in small groups their design. </li>
<li>Week 3-4 HW: Have your second designs 3d printed. Students may either use dreambox again, or the maker space in Cory Hall. </li>
<li>Week 4: Web-services that relate to 3d printing (Shapeways, Makexyz, Thingiverse). Collaboration, remixing, and their role in producing 3d prints (during the week students are working on their project). Additionally, students will design and print a model of their creation either through an online service (shapeways et. al. ) or on a desktop 3d printer provided by the facilitator.</li>
<li>Week 4-5 HW: Projects will be printed (either by facilitator or via a third party). Find relevant current events relating to 3d printing or the maker movement and bring them to class, present on what you found. </li>
<li>Week 5: Extruders, desktop manufacturing competition, the 5-10x pellet-to-filament markup, open extruder designs, print recycling attempts, and other attempts to reduce the variable costs of 3d printing. Students also get their printed projects back.</li>
<li>Week 5-6 HW: More current events articles. </li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="maker-movement" class="anchor" href="#maker-movement"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Maker movement</h3>

<ul>
<li>Week 6: Start talk on the maker movement. History, notable projects. Talk about make/craft magazine, hackaday, Maker Faire, Bre Petis, makerbot, and weekend projects.</li>
<li>Week 6-7 HW: Research the maker movement and projects people are working on right now. Think of a little way you can contribute to something going on; it doesn't have to be 3d printing. Email me with what you come up with so we can discuss next week.</li>
<li>Week 7: Ladyada, adafruit, wearable electronics, Limor Fried as an entrepreneur and what she did differently, and the amount of recognition she has received because of it. 
Assemble into groups based on project you're working on or are interested in. Discuss what you want to work on for your third small project.</li>
<li>Week 7-8 HW: Email me your completed 3d design (if going the 3d printing route) for your third project, or finish your project to demo in class. 
I will be printing the designs of those going the 3d printing route. </li>
<li>Week 8: The rise of public and private hackerspaces/fab-labs, hacker culture, the new TI hackerspace on campus.</li>
<li>Week 8-9 HW: Start thinking of a final project. Bring an idea (or many) to class to pitch in groups. </li>
<li>Week 9: The microcontroller/Arduino part of the maker movement. What makes the Arduino so special? Notable projects. Bring in Arduino to class with a demo project.
Work in groups discussing your final project. </li>
<li>Wekk 9-10 HW: CAD most of your final project</li>
<li>Weeks 10: Crowdfunding. Current crowdfunding websites: Kickstarter, Tindie, Indiegogo, etc. Notable crowdfunding successes and how this ties into the maker movement. Fixed and variable costs, and how crowdfunding helps with this. How 3d printing turns the fixed-cost industry of injection molding into a variable-cost industry of 3d printing parts on an on-demand basis.
Pitch final project to class with a prototype or rough CAD of what you plan to make. The class will give  feedback. </li>
<li>Weeks 10-11 HW: Email me your CAD files early in the week to be printed, if 3d printing. Otherwise have your project finished by next week
I will be printing projects. </li>
<li>Week 11: Final Presentations on projects.</li>
